## VassarEats

## Description
VassarEats is a robust, highly interactive dining application that aids users (Vassar students, staff, and visitors) to
make informed dining decisions quicker. It pulls all the dining information from [Vassar dining website](https://vassar.cafebonappetit.com/).
It is a better alternative to this website because it adds important features which are not in the website. Some of these
features are allowing customers to like or dislike dining options and view total likes for each food item.

## How to run the prototype
Run the app on Android Studio. When the program is run, it will welcome you to Vassar Eats and display the food menu for 
Gordon Commons as the default food menu. You can choose your dietary preferences, dates, and different dining locations 
and the food menu will be adjusted accordingly.

## Functionality
We have a prototype that displays all the food menu in an expandable recycler view format. The food menu displayed includes
mealType (e.g. Breakfast, Lunch, etc.), mealTypeSection (e.g. Specials, additional favorites, etc.) and diningSection (e.g.
Stocks, Root, etc.). More so, the food menu can be filtered based on dietary preferences (e.g. vegan, vegetarian, etc.). 
A user can also view food items up to seven days from the current day. Moreover, different dining locations (e.g., Express,
Street Eats) can be selected to view the food menu for that day in those dining locations. Another cool functionality we've
added is to enable users to like each food item and see the total likes for each food item.
