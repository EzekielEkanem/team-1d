## VassarEats

## Description
VassarEats is a robust, highly interactive dining application that aids users (Vassar students, staff, and visitors) to
make informed dining decisions quicker. It pulls all the dining information from [Vassar dining website](https://vassar.cafebonappetit.com/).
It is a better alternative to this website because it adds important features which are not in the website. Some of these
features are:

1. It can allow customers to like or dislike dining options.
2. It recommends dining options to customers based on their preferences (both present day and future recommendations).
3. It provides a comment section for each food item where customers can give real time feedback to other users and dining
administrators.

## How to run the prototype
Run the main method contained in the Main Class. When the program is run, it will welcome you to Vassar Eats and ask you to choose your preferences with their respective numbers. Input
a number or comma separated numbers between 1 and 8 inclusive to select you preferences.

## Functionality
We have a prototype that prints out all the food menu, including their mealType (e.g. Breakfast, Lunch, etc.),
mealTypeSection (e.g. Specials, additional favorites, etc.) and diningSection (e.g. Stocks, Root, etc.). More so, we have been 
able to filter the food menu based on dietary preferences (e.g. vegan, vegetarian, etc.). Presently, we are limiting users'
food options to Gordon Commons menu, and the user can only view the menu options for October 31st, 2024. The user cannot 
unselect preferences. The program has to restart to be able to reselect preferences. All these are issues that will be 
resolved in the next iteration.
